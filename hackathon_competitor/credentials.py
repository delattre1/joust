"""Where the Plow line credential lives, and nothing about what is in it.

An operator asked, mid-release, why Joust would ever need to ask a person
where their credential is once `PLOW_CREDENTIALS` or `PLOW_CREDENTIALS_PATH`
(or a `.env` next to
the checkout, the same thing Compose itself reads) is already configured.
The credential's *path* is not secret, and Joust already has an explicit
contract for it — `PLOW_CREDENTIALS`/`PLOW_CREDENTIALS_PATH`, falling back to
`./plow-credentials` — so resolving it is a matter of reading one named
variable in a fixed order, never a filesystem search, and the file itself
is never opened here: existence and mode can be checked without reading a
single byte of its contents.
