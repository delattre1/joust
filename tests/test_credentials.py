"""Where the Plow credential is, without ever asking a configured operator.

An operator who already set `PLOW_CREDENTIALS_PATH` (or the same key in a
`.env` next to the checkout) must never be asked "where is your credential?" —
Joust already has the contract; it just has to read it in a fixed, honest
order and never open the file it names.
